[RELEASE] Ropanion - AI-Powered Roblox Studio Companion

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to share Ropanion, a new AI tool I've been working on to help with Roblox development. It's designed to make scripting, debugging, UI and more a bit easier for everyone, especially new devs that actually try to learn.

Just a heads up: This is a passion project, so updates come when I have time to work on it.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Ropanion?

Basically, it's an AI companion that works right inside Roblox Studio. Whether you're experienced or just starting out, it can help speed up your workflow and solve problems faster.

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & Security

Your privacy matters! Ropanion:

## ðŸŒŸ Why Try Ropanion?

Ever been stuck debugging something spread across multiple scripts? Instead of copying everything to an external AI, you can just ask Ropanion directly in Studio:

```
"Check why this error is happening in script1, script2, or game.SSS.Main"
```

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:**
â€¢ **Be specific** - the more details you give, the better the results
â€¢ **AI limitations** - remember that most AI models aren't perfect with Luau sometimes, so results may vary

It's all about making Roblox development smoother for everyone in our community! ðŸš€

## ðŸŽ® Ready to Try It?

I'd recommend testing it in a copy of your place first, just to be safe. I've tried to catch potential issues, but better safe than sorry.

**Troubleshooting:** If you have any issues or get stuck, try uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin. Sorry, but this is all I can do at this time ðŸ˜…

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!
