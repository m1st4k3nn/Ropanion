[RELEASE] AI Ropanion - AI-Powered Roblox Studio Companion

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to share Ropanion, a new AI tool I've been working on to help with Roblox development. It's designed to make scripting and debugging a bit easier for all of us.

Just a heads up: This is a passion project, so updates come when I have time to work on it.

ðŸŽ¯ **What is Ropanion?**
Basically, it's an AI companion that works right inside Roblox Studio. Whether you're experienced or just starting out, it can help speed up your workflow and solve problems faster.

ðŸ”— **Links:**
â€¢ **Landing Page:** https://ropanion.vercel.app
â€¢ **Roblox Store:** https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/112432781546778
â€¢ **GitHub:** https://github.com/m1st4k3nn/Ropanion

ðŸ§ª **Early Testing Phase**
This is the first release, and I'm treating it as a testing period to get community feedback. Everything works, but keep in mind:

â€¢ More features and improvements are coming soon
â€¢ I'll be adding stuff based on what you all suggest

ðŸ”’ **Privacy First**
â€¢ No personal data collection
â€¢ No usage tracking
â€¢ No storing of your scripts
â€¢ All processing is local or through privacy-focused AI services

ðŸ’¬ **Need Help?**
If you run into issues or have ideas:
â€¢ Hit me up on Discord: @m1st4k3n
â€¢ Reply here with feedback
â€¢ DM me on the forums

ðŸŒŸ **Why Try It?**
Ever been stuck debugging something spread across multiple scripts? Instead of copying everything to an external AI, you can just ask Ropanion directly in Studio: "Check why this error is happening in script1, script2, or game.SSS.Main"

It's all about making Roblox development smoother for everyone in our community.

ðŸŽ® **Give it a shot!**

I'd recommend testing it in a copy of your place first, just to be safe. I've tried to catch potential issues, but better safe than sorry.

Looking forward to your thoughts!
